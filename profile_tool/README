This README includes the quick guide to help you run the profile tool on your system.

Summary
========
The tool already tested on CLX and SLX platform, with native workload and KVM workload on
below kernel version:
Linux 4.20.0
Linux 5.3.0-rc3

Pre-request
==========
Let's assume the directory you put the source code is $ROOT

- Main file structure:
$ROOT/kernel_module:  The out of tree kernel module source directory
$ROOT/profile_tool: The source directory of profile tool
$ROOT/profile_tool/log/pid_xxx: The log folder, log saved by PID here.

- Build:
Run $ROOT/profile_tool/build.sh
You should run this script again after you booted with another kernel or pulled from repo.
This script checks the binary tool dependence, build the kernel module against the running
kernel and the sys-refs tool.
It also downloads the pmu-tools form GITHUB if the capability of local installed perf is
not enough. 

Usage
=====
The tool can profile a running KVM workload or native workload.

Example:
The AEP in system combined by 128GB X 4 in 2-1-1 configuration, the target PID is 100,
we want to leave 25% hot pages to NUMA node 0, leave remain cold pages to NUMA node 1,
run total 120 seconds in profiling stage:

$ROOT/profile_tool/profile.sh -p 100 -d 25 -h 0 -c 1 -m 128 -i 211 -t 120

You can also run profile.sh without parameters to get help information.

Please refer the dcpmem_hw_information.yaml to know the supported DCPMEM type.


Limitation:
========
- Low accurate on KVM workload:
To build a pure out of tree kernel module without patch customer's running kernel,
we removed patches which allow our kernel module checking the actual invalid SPTE
entries due to page migration in HOST side, so for KVM workload the tool can
only work in low accuracy mode. 

Known Issue:
==========
- Incorrect HOT/COLD node detection result sometimes:
We planned to detect the HOT/COLD nodes automatically to reduce overheads in customer side,
But this feature is not stable enough so far, but we have the -h and -c parameters to override it,
Solution: currently please keep use the -c and -h and don't rely on this feature.
